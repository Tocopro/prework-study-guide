## Description


The Bootcamp Project

This Bootcamp project was to show how to use git and Github when developing a project by code with other developers.
The Project initial steps were to download files that were already created by the tutor and installing them in visual studio.
The initial steps downloaded were template for the project
Each section in the bootcamp prework study guide was created to ensure that the student understands the methods used to create 
A file in visual studio and storing the code version in the Github where other developers can view its progress and add certain features
Using git. 
The addition can be added as a branch which is later merged with the main branch. If any problems occur the creators can always resort to a previous
Code version via Github.
My motivation in creating this study guide webpage was to have an easier access to topics and subjects I will be learning in this course.
It is a webpage subject with different subjects to be covered. HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
There will be many topics in this study and organizing the topics for easier access is crucial. The study will be much more comprehensive 
If the student will be able to access the right subject and make contribution that can be stored in a place that will enable them to have easier access
Building this project was to give me the experience and knowledge in the most basic fundamental way on how to initiate a similar project while using the github repository 
For code version editing and safe storage. Github will also enable me to access other developers who can look at my code and make the necessary contribution to add features which can be merged 
 To the main code safely and efficiently.
I was able to learn the capable features that are within GitHub using git. Github was an area that I had not used in the past while working on coding projects.
This allowed me to see the vast possibilities that Github provides in working collaboratively with other developers.
My project will be unique on the basis of a beginner in coding, experimenting with different features or capabilities. The final product will be able to stand out and appeal 
To the end user.
As a developer I have access to make changes to my project. In due time different ideas can be incorporated to the main project to improve the functionality
Of the webpage.  
Everything that is featured on my webpage is the work I have put into my project and it will be unique to my taste and style. The main goal is to make easier for me to 
Access information on my webpage easily and efficiently.

## Usage


There are four sections on the webpage which contains 
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
•	GIT

In this section we include information about creating a webpage using HTML
How each element is used in that process
Text element
Image element
List element 
Header element
Then there is the section which divides the HTML into three sections
Meta-related elements
Content division elements 
Semantic elements

In the Section for CSS
Creation of Webpage by styling
Created a CSS file that is external and link it to the HTML page.
The CSS file provide styling to the webpage such as margin in blue and
The image of a cat which was downloaded with the prework study guide.
The CSS file contains elements as selectors for the HTML content or it can 
Class attributes.

In the section for GIT
Creating repository in GitHub to store the code.
The main branch will contain different branches such as
HTML branch, CSS branch and JavaScript  branch.
Code can be added reviewed then merged in the branches
Without affecting the main code. If the added or revised code 
Is compatible the code is then merged to launch the new features.

In the section for JavaScript
In this section the code for JavaScript is used in conjunction with the HTML 
Code to provide functionality for the web page. The JavaScript file is linked up with the
HTML file and as the control reads the code from top to bottom the JavaScript code is 
Placed in between the script tags.
