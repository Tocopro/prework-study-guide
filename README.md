# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description


The Bootcamp Project

This Bootcamp project was to show how to use git and Github when developing a project by code with other developers.
The Project initial steps were to download files that were already created by the tutor and installing them in visual studio.
The initial steps downloaded were template for the project
Each section in the bootcamp prework study guide was created to ensure that the student understands the methods used to create 
A file in visual studio and storing the code version in the Github where other developers can view its progress and add certain features
Using git. 
The addition can be added as a branch which is later merged with the main branch. If any problems occur the creators can always resort to a previous
Code version via Github.
My motivation in creating this study guide webpage was to have an easier access to topics and subjects I will be learning in this course.
It is a webpage subject with different subjects to be covered. HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
There will be many topics in this study and organizing the topics for easier access is crucial. The study will be much more comprehensive 
If the student will be able to access the right subject and make contribution that can be stored in a place that will enable them to have easier access
Building this project was to give me the experience and knowledge in the most basic fundamental way on how to initiate a similar project while using the github repository 
For code version editing and safe storage. Github will also enable me to access other developers who can look at my code and make the necessary contribution to add features which can be merged 
 To the main code safely and efficiently.
I was able to learn the capable features that are within GitHub using git. Github was an area that I had not used in the past while working on coding projects.
This allowed me to see the vast possibilities that Github provides in working collaboratively with other developers.
My project will be unique on the basis of a beginner in coding, experimenting with different features or capabilities. The final product will be able to stand out and appeal 
To the end user.
As a developer I have access to make changes to my project. In due time different ideas can be incorporated to the main project to improve the functionality
Of the webpage.  
Everything that is featured on my webpage is the work I have put into my project and it will be unique to my taste and style. The main goal is to make easier for me to 
Access information on my webpage easily and efficiently.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
